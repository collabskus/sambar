# Sambar Code Review Summary

## Critical Security Risk
Your widget system executes arbitrary C# code without sandboxing:
```csharp
obj = await CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync<T>(script, options: options);
```
Any `.cs` file in WidgetPacks can access files, install malware, or compromise the system. This is a show-stopper security vulnerability.

## Resource Management Failures
- Static file handles never disposed: `public static FileStream logFile = File.Open(...)`
- Infinite loops without cancellation tokens: `while (true)` with no exit mechanism
- Event subscriptions never unsubscribed, causing memory leaks

## Architecture Problems
- God object: `Api` class handles everything across 15+ files
- Static coupling: `Sambar.api.someMethod()` calls everywhere make testing impossible
- No error checking on Win32 API calls
- Excessive polling (100ms intervals) instead of Windows events

## Immediate Fixes Required
1. **Security**: Sandbox widget execution or redesign the plugin system
2. **Resources**: Implement IDisposable patterns and CancellationTokens
3. **Threading**: Add proper dispatcher checks for UI updates
4. **Win32**: Add error handling and return value validation

## Technical Strengths
Despite these issues, the project shows deep Windows API knowledge, creative taskbar interception, and solid widget architecture concepts. The core functionality is impressive but needs significant safety hardening before any public use.

The security vulnerability alone makes this unsuitable for distribution without major architectural changes to the widget loading system.
